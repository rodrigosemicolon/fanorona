movement:
    White moves first.  Pieces are moved by sliding one space along one of the the lines.  Note that some points lie on diagonal lines, while others have only horizontal and vertical directions (strong vs weak intersections).

capturing:
    you can capture a line of your opponent's pieces by approach by moving toward them into the adjacent space, or by withdrawal by starting in the adjacent space and moving directly away from your opponent's piece.   In some positions, you could capture either way, and you must choose one or the other.

a turn:
    consists of either a single, non-capturing move, or a sequence of capturing moves.   If any capturing moves are possible anywhere on the board, then a capturing move must be made.  If multiple captures are possible, you can choose which to do. 

restrictions on subsequent captures in a turn:
    you must keep moving the same piece
    you cannot return to any space twice
    you can't move in the same direction twice in a row
